This code is in an attempt to make a template webpage for Project 1

After taking some time to reflect I realized that I wasn't thinking about the div within divs and their classes correctly, which ultimately translates to the way that you CSS will be structured. This was a better attempt.  I also accidentally saved on to my master file, where all of my new commits were housed and then went back and copied my modified code on my gh-pages in case you didnâ€™t see enough commits
